wordpress-upload-post - upoad post to wordpress

DESCRIPTION
    If you provide a date, we check for correctness before attempt. If you
    specify a category or more, we check that they do exist.

  Motivation
    I've workded on other cli scripts to wordpress- but I found them too
    complex. This simply allows you to post content to a category in your
    blog, via the comand line.

USAGE
    wordpress-upload-post [OPTIONS].. [PATH|DESCRIPTION]

       -d path     simple text/html FILE containing content 
       -h          help
       -t string   title *
       -D string   date
       -c number   category name or id, can be comma separated 
       -u string   username *
       -p string   password *
       -x url      proxy, xmlrpc address *
       -n          don't post, just test
       -k          clean description text

    * Required.

  USAGE EXAMPLES
    Load the login info from a file: wordpress-upload-post -d ./content.txt
    -t 'Red House Found' -C ./conf.txt

    Login conf example file:

       -u usenamejim
       -p passew2t42t
       -x http://jimmysite.net/xmlrpc.php

    Set a date for the post, also upload to category 'yummy' and 'broke',
    you can also specify an id for a category instead, we check that the
    category exists.

       wordpress-upload-post -D 'June 2001' -t 'simple title' -c 'yummy,broke,35' -u leo -p 2g32 -x http://site.com/xmlrpc.php

    You may specify the file with content for the description (the body of
    the post), via -d argument or via an argument. Not both, and not more
    than one.

   clean description text flag
    If you want to clean the description text, use the -k flag. This makes
    it so

       This is another kind of 
       break that happens here.
   
       As well as this 
        one.

    Gets turned to

       This is another kind of break that happens here.
   
       As well as this 
        one.

    This is useful if you have as decription input file, properly formatted
    80 char wide data. This prevents wordpress from inserting breaks where
    we don't want them. For the web, it's best to have only paragraphs, the
    user can set the width and.. well. You know the argument.
